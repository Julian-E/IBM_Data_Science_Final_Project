This capstone project needed to be submitted in order to gain the professional certificate "IBM Data Sciene".

The final task was to find the most suitable location for a new gym in three cities. For this purpose, the "Foursquare API" was used to obtain various data.
Geographic data was obtained using the "BeautifulSoup" and "Geocoder" libraries. An unsupervised machine learning model was used to analyze and process these data.

Libraries used: Pandas, Folium, Numpy, BeautifulSoup, Geocoder, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

Machine learning algorithms used: K-means.  

The project was written in a Jupyter notebook, which can be used to show the code and the output simultaneously.
